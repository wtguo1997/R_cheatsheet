# data: data$V1, data$V2, data$V3...
# V1 is factorial, V2 is numerical, V3 is outcome

## One-way ANOVA
# cell mean form
# factor effect form
res.aov <- aov(V3 ~ V1, data = data) 
summary(res.aov)
 
# test whether there is any association between V3 and V1:
# read Pr in ANOVA summary
 
# access the information in the form of regression output using the summary.lm command.
aov1 <- aov(V3 ~ V1, data = data)
summary.lm(aov1)

## Simultaneous inference
# If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of falsely rejecting at least one of them increases 
# beyond the pre-specified significance level. Therefore, we need to use simultaneous inference procedures to adjust for 
# multiplicity and control the overall type I error rate.

# pairwise t-tests with Bonferroniâ€™s correction:
pairwise.t.test(data$V3, data$V1, p.adjust.method="bonferroni")
# result p-value smaller means significant difference

# Multiple Tukey pairwise comparisons:
