# cell mean form
# factor effect form

# test whether there is any association between V3 and V1:

## Contrast
# see 207 discussion3

## Simultaneous inference
# If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of falsely rejecting at least one of them increases 
# beyond the pre-specified significance level. Therefore, we need to use simultaneous inference procedures to adjust for 
# multiplicity and control the overall type I error rate.

# pairwise t-tests with Bonferroniâ€™s correction:
pairwise.t.test(data$V3, data$V1, p.adjust.method="bonferroni")
# result p-value smaller means significant difference

# Multiple Tukey pairwise comparisons (The best):
# only works for pairwise-comparison
res.aov <- aov(V3 ~ V1, data = data) 
TukeyHSD(res.aov)

# Scheffe method for pairwise and otherwise comparisons:
# need contrast.matrix
ScheffeTest(res.aov, contrasts = contrast.matrix)

## model diagnostics: normality and homogeneity of variance; outliers
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
plot(res.aov)
# 1. residuals vs Fitted
# 2. Normal QQ -> normality of error term
# 3. scale-location
# 4. leverage

# Variance homogenerity: Barlett's or Levene's test
bartlett.test(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
leveneTest(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
# if p-values less than 0.05 -> homogenerity is rejected

# Variance Normality: Shapiro-Wilk normality test
aov_residuals <- residuals(object = res.aov) 
shapiro.test(x = aov_residuals)
# if p-values less than 0.05 -> normality is rejected

# Tuskey method: whether highest weight is significantly higher than the 2nd highest:
